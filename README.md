## Features

- Apply built-in filters such as blur, edge enhancement
- Apply custom filters using convolution kernels
- Save the filtered images
- Display the filtered images

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pillow

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sonnymay/image-filters-and-effects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd image-filters-and-effects
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install Pillow
   ```

### Usage

1. Place an image in the same directory as the script or provide a full path to an image.

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python image_filters_and_effects.py
   ```

3. The script will create and save new images with various filters applied. The new images will be saved in the same directory as the script.

4. The script will also display the images with filters applied.

## Customization

You can experiment with different filters and effects by modifying the script. Pillow offers a variety of built-in filters, and you can also create your own by changing kernel values in the custom filter.
